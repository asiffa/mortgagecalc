This is a personal coding project that I developed in Typescript. It is also hosted on Netlify for public use (https://mymortgage.netlify.app/).

The purpose of this tool is to help people, ideally joint purchasers, understand the costs of buying their future home.

It allows users to input information about their personal finances, current home valuation, future home costs, administrative fees, and bills - and dynamically and immediately provides information about the future costs.

It has a slider which allows the user to adjust the proportion of the costs according to who should be paying more or less, among two purchasers.
